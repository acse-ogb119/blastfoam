# Triple-Point Shock Interaction

## Notes

This case is a Riemann problem with three states and two materials, where the the domain is split into three separate regions. Each region has an ideal gas equation of state. This case is designed to test the ability to propagate shocks over a multi-material regions and capture the generation of vorticity.

The case takes approximately 37 min to run on a 4 core desktop.
